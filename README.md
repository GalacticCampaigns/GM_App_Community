### üöÄ About Galactic Campaigns

**Galactic Campaigns** is your ultimate companion tool for running Star Wars Saga Edition (and eventually other Star Wars TTRPGs!) campaigns. Originally founded as a Play-by-Post forum, and now thriving on Discord, Galactic Campaigns assists GMs by providing:

* **AI-Powered GM Assistance:** Intelligent worldbuilding support and game state management.
* **Local Data Storage:** Securely stores your campaign lore, character profiles, and session logs locally.
* **Discord Integration:** Tools to process Discord chat logs for narrative extraction and future seamless play.
* **Customization:** Controls for AI behavior, app modes, and personalized settings.

Our goal is to enhance your GMing experience, making it easier and more immersive to tell epic Star Wars stories.
